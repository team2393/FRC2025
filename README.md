Timeline
--------

 * Now: Prepare for next season.
   Last year, a preview was offered in https://github.com/wpilibsuite/2024Beta
   This year, there is little up-front information.

   Start with the 2024 "WPILib Installation Guide" mentioned above.
   Read the Software manual. Read all until "Advanced programming",
   may skip the LabVIEW, python, C++ detail since we're using Java.
   Glance throught the Advanced programming section to at least know
   what exists there for later study in more detail.

 * January 4: Kickoff, https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/kickoff, https://www.tnfirst.org/frc-events
   - Install 2025 version of WPILib, driver station, CTR and REV libraries

 * Throughout January
   - Program a drive base (last year's robot, swervebot, ...) with current software
   - Prepare autonomous moves
   - Try to prepare software for other robot components as they are defined & designed
