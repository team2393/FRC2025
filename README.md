Timeline
--------

 * Prepare for next season.
   Last year, a preview was offered in https://github.com/wpilibsuite/2024Beta
   This year, there seem to be no large changes.

   Start with the 2024 "WPILib Installation Guide" mentioned above.
   Read the Software manual. Read all until "Advanced programming",
   may skip the LabVIEW and C++ detail since we're using Java.
   Glance throught the Advanced programming section to at least know
   what exists there for later study in more detail.

 * Early January: Kickoff, https://www.tnfirst.org/frc-events
   - Install 2025 WPILib, driver station, CTR and REV libraries

 * Throughout January
   - Program a drive base (last year's robot, swervebot, ...) with current software
   - Prepare autonomous moves
   - Try to prepare software for other robot components as they are designed

 * February
   - Test software for other robot components, update autonomouse moves
     to include picking up game pieces etc.

 * March, April: Competitions
