Game manual: Will be on https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/competition-manual-qa-system

Software manual: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/

 * The "Introduction" has links to Java learning resources.
   See also [Free Java Book](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java-2e/)
 * See "Step 2: Installing Software", "WPILib Installation Guide".
   (For now, that uses https://github.com/wpilibsuite/2025Beta)
 * See "Basic Programming", "Git Version Control" for installing `git`

Get robot code
--------------
 * Start "2025 WPILib VS Code". Invoke "View", "Command Palette...", "Git clone".
   Enter the URL `https://github.com/team2393/FRC2025.git`.
   For a target location, create a folder "git" in your home directory
   and place the git clone there. Select "Open" when then asked to open
   what you just fetched from git.
 * "View", "Command Palette", "WPILib: Simulate Robot Code"
   * In simulation, use the menu "Network Tables",  "Smart Dashboard" to show "Field", "DemoMechanism" and "Selectable Chooser".
   * Connect joystick and drive around in teleop
   * Select auto option and run it in autonomous

Timeline
--------

 * Now: 
   Start with the "WPILib Installation Guide" mentioned above.
   Read the Software manual. Read all of it until "Advanced programming".
   May skip the details about LabVIEW, python, C++ since we're using Java.
   Glance throught the Advanced programming section to at least know
   what's in there.

   Prepare for next season by using the 2025Beta release

   - [X] Run Falcon and Pigeon with beta software
   - [X] Port swervebot to beta software
   - [ ] Test any hardware that we'll likely use on the robot

 * January 4: Kickoff, https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/kickoff, https://www.tnfirst.org/frc-events
   - Install 2025 version of WPILib, driver station, CTR and REV libraries

 * Throughout January
   - Program a drive base (last year's robot, swervebot, ...) with current software
   - Prepare autonomous moves
   - Try to prepare software for other robot components as they are defined & designed

 * February
   - Test software for other robot components
   - Update autonomouse moves to include picking up game pieces etc.
