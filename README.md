Game manual: Will be on https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/competition-manual-qa-system

Software manual: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/

 * The very first page, "Introduction", has links to Java learning resources.
   See also [Free Java Book](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java-2e/)
 * See "Step 2: Installing Software", "WPILib Installation Guide".
   For now, use the copy on https://github.com/wpilibsuite/2025Beta.
 * See "Basic Programming", "Git Version Control" for installing `git`
 * Start "2025 WPILib VS Code". Invoke "View", "Command Palette...", "Git clone".
   Enter the URL "https://github.com/team2393/FRC2025.git".
   For a target location, create a folder "git" in your home directory
   and place the git clone there. Select "Open" when then asked to open
   what you just fetched from git.

Timeline
--------

 * Now: Prepare for next season by using the 2025Beta release

   - [X] Run Falcon and Pigeon with beta software
   - [ ] Port swervebot to beta software
   - [ ] Test any hardware that we'll likely use on the robot

   Start with the "WPILib Installation Guide" mentioned above.
   Read the Software manual. Read all of it until "Advanced programming".
   May skip the details about LabVIEW, python, C++ since we're using Java.
   Glance throught the Advanced programming section to at least know
   what's in there.
